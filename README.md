# relative_anonymity_metric
python script for plotting entropy in a network

this script implements a measurement of anonymity in a network consisting of N devices if an attacker has captured one frame. it outputs the entropy (the level of uncertainty that the attacker has w.r.t. whether the frame is attributable to any single device) when configurable bits in the MAC frame header are visible over the air. it was written to give a sense of intuition of the scale of various privacy improvements proposed in the ieee 802.11 privacy enhanced wlan features task group.
